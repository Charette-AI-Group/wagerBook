"""Base class for a view that tells the window how things are going.

Views should not own the status bar or open dialogs themselves: a view does
not know whether it is a tab, a panel, or the whole window, and two of those
have no status bar to write to. It says what happened; the window decides
where that goes.

Inherit from this for tabs and panels, and hand each one to
`MainWindow.connectView`. Unused until you add a view of your own.
