r"""PyInstaller build of the application. Driven by tools\buildExe.py.

A one-folder build rather than one-file, on purpose:

  - It starts immediately. A one-file build unpacks the whole Qt runtime to a
    temporary folder on every launch, which for a bundle this size is a wait
    before anything appears, every single time.
  - The installer wants a folder anyway, and an uninstaller that removes a
    folder is easier to reason about than one chasing a self-extractor.

What ships is the read-only half: the package and its icon, the manual that
Help falls back to when there is no network, and certifi's certificate list
for Update Prices. Everything the app writes - the book and its settings -
lives under APPDATA and is created on first run.
